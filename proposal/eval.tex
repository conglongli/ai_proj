\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:goal}
First, evaluated our indirection technique by integer
linear programming (ILP) formulations. In the paper, Liu \textit{et al.\ }~\cite{Liu:2015}
provided a ILP formulation of the scheduling problem without indirection
considerations. We built a new formulation adding indirection to Liu's formulation.
Then used Gurobi~\cite{gurobi}
ILP solver to solve scheduling problems with the two formulations in order
to find the optimal improvement by indirection.

Then we evaluated our indirection techinque in simulation. We received the
simulator of the Solstice algorithm from the authors, and introduced
our techinque into the simulator to compare it with the original algorithm.

%The simulation results will be comparable in terms of number of configurations,
%and the total time to serve all demands.
